# Noah-Law
# This website was created by @ssemeniuk8 for Noah's Law organization

On September 16th, 2021, Mchale Erica Busch and Noah Lee McConnel were killed in a tragedy that brought awareness to Canadian Residents that change is needed.

This website is to bring awareness and ease of access to the petitions for anyone to download.

While is it a simple page, it means a lot to me to help them out with this simple little website. It brings everything to one place and allows people to 
easily find everything to do with the movement.

Thank you, and please check out the webpage for yourself.
